# MyReads Project

This is My solution to the Udacity React Nanodegree course first project 'MyReads App'
I created the project from scratch using create-react-app command and then used the static html,css and the backend api 'BooksAPI' provided by Udacity. I then followed the instruction and implement the app logic.

## TL;DR
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Create React App
